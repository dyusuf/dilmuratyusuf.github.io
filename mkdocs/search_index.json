It comes with most of the popular\nbioinformatics tools already installed and ready for use. There are many\nGalaxy servers around the world and some are tailored to specific\ntoolsets and reference data for analysis of human genomics, microbial\ngenomics, proteomics etc.\n\n\nThere are some introductory slides available\n\nhere\n.\n\n\nBasically, the Galaxy interface is separated into 3 parts. The tool list\non the left, the viewing pane in the middle and the analysis and data\nhistory on the right. We will be looking at all 3 parts in this\ntutorial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning Objectives\n\n\nAt the end of this tutorial you should:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe able to upload data to a Galaxy server from:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA file on your local computer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA file on a remote datastore with an accessible URL\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA file on a public dataset\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe able to use tools in Galaxy by:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccessing the tool via the tool menu\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the tool interface to run the particular tool\n\n\n\n\n\n\nViewing/accessing the tool output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBe able to create a simple workflow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 1: Preparation.\n\n\nThe purpose of this section is to get you to log into the MDC server.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGo to \nMDC galaxy production sever\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLog in:\n\n\n\n\nEnter your MDC user name\n\n\nEnter your password\n\n\nClick \nOK\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 2: Getting data into Galaxy\n\n\nThere are 3 main ways to get your data into Galaxy. We will use each of\nthese methods for 3 files and then use those 3 files for the rest\nof the workshop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStart a new history for this workshop. To do this:\n\n\n\n\nClick on the history menu button (the\n    \n icon)\n    at the top of the Histories panel.\n\n\nSelect \nCreate New\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt is important to note that Galaxy has the concept of \"File Type\" built\nin. This means that each file stored needs to have its type described to\nGalaxy as it is being made available. Examples of file types are text,\nfasta, fastq, vcf, GFF, Genbank, tabular etc.\n\n\nWe will tell Galaxy what type of file each one is as we upload it.\n\n\nMethod 1: Upload a file from your own computer\n\n\nWith this method, you can get most of the files on your own computer into\nGalaxy. (there is a size limit)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the following file to your computer:\n    \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/1oryi4ynczi7yhk/Contig_stats.txt.gz?raw=1\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Galaxy tool panel, click on \nGet Data -\n Upload\n    File\n\n\nClick the \nChoose local file\n button\n\n\nFind and select the \nContig_stats.txt.gz\n file you downloaded\n    and click \nOpen\n\n\nSet the \"Type\" to \ntabular\n\n\nClick the \nStart\n button\n\n\nOnce the progress bar reaches 100%, click the \nClose\n button\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe file will now upload to your current history.\n\n\nMethod 2: Upload a file from a URL\n\n\nIf a file exists on a web resource somewhere and you know its URL\n(Unique resource location - a web address) you can directly load it into\nGalaxy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the tool panel, click on \nGet Data -\n Upload File\n\n\n\n\nClick on the \nPaste/Fetch Data\n button\n\n\nCopy and paste the following web address into the URL/Text box:\n    \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/6gjydgapnlgvvgj/Galaxy1-GSE37268_mof3.out_chr.hpeak.txt?raw=1\n\n\nSet the \"Type\" to \ninterval\n, the 'Genome' to \nmm9\n\n\nClick \nStart\n\n\nOnce the progress bar has reached 100%, click \nClose\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMethod 3: Get data from a public dataset\n\n\nWe also need a list of genes in mouse, which we can obtain from UCSC.\nGalaxy has the UCSC table browser integrated as a tool,\nso we don't need to download the data to our computers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the tool panel, lick on \nGet Data -\n UCSC main table browser\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelect clade \"Mammal\", genome \"Mouse\", assembly \"mm9\"\n\n\n\n\nSelect group \"Genes and Gene Prediction Tracks\", track \"RefSeq Genes\"\n\n\nSelect table \"refGene\"\n\n\nSelect region \"genome\"\n\n\nSelect output format \"BED\"\n\n\nClick button \"get output\"\n\n\nClick button \"Send query to Galaxy\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 3: Play with the tools\n\n\nThe purpose of this section is to get you used to use the available\ntools in Galaxy and point out some of the more basic manipulation tools.\n\n\nFirstly, however, you\u2019ll notice that one file has very long and\nconfusing name. So we might want to change it. To do this we need to\n\u201cedit\u201d the file. So:\n\n\n\n\nClick on the\n    the pencil icon (edit) next to the file in the history called:\n    \nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/6gjydgapnlgvvgj/Galaxy1-GSE37268_mof3.out_chr.hpeak.txt?raw=1\n\n\nIn the \"Name\" text box, give it a new name. Call it: \nPeak interval\n\n\nClick the \nSave\n button.\n\n\n\n\nNow that\u2019s better. There was a lot of other functionality hidden behind\nthat edit\n(\n)\nicon. You can change a file\u2019s data type, convert its format and many\nother things. Feel free to play around with them.\n\n\nOk, back to the tools.\n\n\nThis example shows how to cut out a couple of\ncolumns, remove a line and then produce a histogram. This will introduce\nsome of the text manipulation tools.\n\n\nClick on the\n\n\nicon of the \nContig_stats.txt\n file to have a look at it. Note that\nthere are 18 columns in this file. We want column 1 and column 6. To do\nthis:\n\n\n1. Cut out column 1 and column 6.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the tool panel, click on \nText Manipulation -\n Cut\n and\n    set the following:\n\n\nSet \"Cut Columns\" to: \nc1,c6\n\n\n\"Delimited by\": \nTab\n\n\n\"Cut from\": \nContig_stats.txt\n\n\nClick \nExecute\n\n\n\n\nExamine the new file by clicking on it\u2019s\n\n\nicon. We now have 2 columns instead of the 18 in the original file.\n\n\n2. Remove the Header lines of the new file.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the tool panel, click on \nText Manipulation -\n Remove\n    beginning\n and set the following:\n\n\n\"Remove First\": \n1\n\n\n\"from\": \nCut on data X\n\n\nclick \nExecute\n\n\n\n\nNote the new file is the same as the previous one without the header\nline.\n\n\n3: Visualize Genomic Intervals\n\n\nTo visualize the peaks it's best to convert them to BED format first\n(because interval format just exists in Galaxy).\n\n\n\n\nClick on the pencil icon of the dataset, \nPeak interval\n\n\nUnder the header \"Convert Format\" select \"Convert Genomic Intervals to BED\"\n\n\nClick \"Convert\"\n\n\nLook at the new dataset. Some columns with generic names have been added and others were removed to comply with BED format rules.\n\n\nExpand the converted BED dataset in history panel\n\n\nClick on \"display at UCSC main\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSection 4: Create workflow\n\n\nWe will create a workflow from an existing history. You can use this\nmethod to make a re-useable analysis from one you\u2019ve already done. i.e.\nYou can perform the analysis once and then create a workflow out of it\nto re-use it on more/new data.\n\n\nStep 1: Find overlaps\n\n\n\n\nFrom the tool panel, click on \nGenomic Interval Operations -\n Intersect interval files\n\n\nReturn: Overlapping Intervals of  \nUCSC Main on Mouse: refGene (genome)\n\nthat intersect \npeak interval\n\n\n\n\nThe order of the inputs is important! We want to end up with a list of genes,\nso the corresponding dataset needs to be the first input.\n\n\nStep 2: Count genes on different chromosomes\n\n\nTo get a better overview of the genes we obtained, we want to look at their distribution across the different chromosomes.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the tool panel, click on \nStatistics -\n count occurrences of each record\n\n\nInput: result from step 1 (Intersect interval files on data X and data Y)\n\n\nSelect column 1 (c1) with the chromosome names\n\n\nclick \nExecute\n\n\n\n\nStep 3: Draw barchart\n\n\nGalaxy has a second option to visualise tabular data, with built-in dynamic visualisations:\n\n\n\n\nInput: result from step 2\n\n\nExpand the dataset view and click on the visualization icon\n\n\nChoose \"Charts\"\n\n\nEnter a chart title, e.g. \"Genes on different chromosomes\"\n\n\nSelect \"Bar diagrams\" -\n \"Regular\"\n\n\nOn the top, click on \"Add Data\"\n\n\nEnter a label, e.g. \"count\"\n\n\nValues for x-axis: Column: 2 [str]\n\n\nValues for y-axis: Column: 1 [int]\n\n\nOn the very top, click \"Draw\"\n\n\n\n\nStep 4: Name  your history\n\n\nIn the history column clicks on \"Unnamed history\" at the top to rename it.\n\n\nStep 5: Make a workflow out of steps 1 to 3\n\n\n\n\nClick on the history options and select \"Extract workflow\"\n\n\nselect the steps you wish to include in the workflow\n\n\nClick \"Create Workflow\"\n\n\n\n\nTo make sure our workflow is correct we look at it in the editor and make some small adjustments.\n\n\nTop menu: Workflow\n\n\n\n\nClick on the name of your new workflow and select \"Edit\"\n\n\n\n\nThe individual steps are displayed as boxes and their outputs and inputs are connected through lines. When you click on a box you see the tool options on the right. Besides, the tools you should see two additional boxes titled \"Input dataset\". These represent the data we want to feed into our workflow.\n\n\nYou should also change the names of the input datasets to remember that the first one contains genes and the second one peaks. Don't forget to save it in the end by clicking on \"Options\" (top right) and selecting \"Save\".\n\n\nStep 6: Share workflow\n\nShare your new workflow with the person to your left.\n\n\nTop menu: Workflow\n\n\n\n\nClick on your workflow's name and select \"Share or publish\"\n\n\nClick \"Share with a user\"\n\n\nEnter the email address of the person to your left (the same as he/she uses to login to Galaxy)\n\n\nHit \"Share\"\n\n\nWait for the person on your right to do the same\n\n\nReload the workflows by clicking again on \"Workflow\" in the top menu\n\n\nUnder the header \"Workflows shared with you by others\" you should now see your right neighbor's workflow\n\n\nClick on its name and select \"View\"\n\n\nCompare with your workflow\n\n\n\n\nRunning the workflow\n\n\nWe can now make a new history called \"Test\" and run the workflow on\nit\u2019s data, automating steps from 1 to 3.\n\n\nWhat now?\n\n\nRemember how we started a new history at the beginning? If you want to\nsee any of your old histories, click on the history menu button\n\n\nat the top of the histories panel and then select \u201cSaved Histories.\u201d\nThis will give you a list of all the histories you have worked on in\nthis Galaxy server.\n\n\nThere\u2019s so much you can do with Workflows. You can even\nrun them on multiple file sets from the one setup.\n\n\nThat's it. You now know a bit about the Galaxy interface and how to load\ndata, run tools and view their outputs.
